Twarchiver - a Twitter Archive Webapp

Summary:

The purpose of this webapp is to store and present a users
history of tweets. The Twitter webapp is focussed on the 
communicative purpose of tweeting, being particularly
strong in highlighting connections and following other
users. This webapp is radically different: it views each
user's history as its own micro-blog, and seeks to present it

    * Chronologically
    * Thematically
    * By participant
    * By arbitrary classification
    and hopefully - attractively

This webapp is read only - it doesn't tweet. What is does
is present reports allowing you to see what you've tweeted when,
and it offers powerful and sophisticated searching using
the full capabilities of perl regular expressions.

Installation:

Step 1: Get the repository

git clone git://github.com/alexkalderimis/twarchiver.git 

(Although it should be said if you want to commit changes to 
the code, please fork the repo first and then make pull
requests to merge your changes back into master)

Step 2: run the build script

In the new directory:

perl Build.PL

Step 3: Install dependencies

You will probably have missing dependencies, so:

./Build installdeps

then repeat step 2

Step 4: Run the tests

./Build test

(tests are broken at this time)

Step 5: Configure your webapp

Change any settings in config.yml that need personalising

Step 6: Run

perl twarchiver.pl
